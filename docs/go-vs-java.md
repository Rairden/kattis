I'm making a list of all my competetive programming runtimes of Java vs Go.

I've done 43 problems in Java, and now I'm learning Go. I love how much faster Go is over Java.

A list of my memorable or interesting problems can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/Rairden/kattis/-/blob/master/docs/favProblems.md).

| problem        | runtime Java (sec) | runtime Go (sec) |
